* Cache Simulator

All in the code.

* Matrix Transpose

The cache has 2^5 sets and each set has 1 2^5-byte cache line, so the
cache can hold 32 \times 8 consecutive =int= objects.

** 32 \times 32

Partition the matrix into 8 \times 8 sub-matrices and working on them.

Unroll the loop on diagonal, since there are conflicts.

** 64 \times 64

partition the 64 \times 64 matrix into 4 32 \times 32 matrices.
