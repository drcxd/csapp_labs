* Phase 1

Phase 1 is simple. It only compares the input string with a given
string, which can be inspected in GDB.

* Phase 2

Phase 2 is more complicated. It first invokes the following function
reads 6 numbers from the input string:

#+begin_src C
  /**
   ,* This function reads six numbers using
   ,* sscanf(str, "%d %d %d %d %d%d", p, p+4, p+8, p+12, p+16, p+20)
   ,* and returns the number of items read
   ,*/
  int read_six_numbers(const char *str, int *p);
#+end_src

Then it examines the value of the 6 numbers. Each number has to pass
its test to defuse phase 2.

* Phase 3
