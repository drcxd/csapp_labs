Basically, this lab is very flexible. The auto-grade script =driver.sh=
does not test the program thoroughly. For example, it does not check
if the program can correctly handle explicit and implicit port. It
does not check if the program correctly handle different HTTP method
(GET, POST, etc.).

For the cache part, it does not test race condition, and the behavior
of the cache. Actually, the behavior of the cache is only specified
vaguely in the write-up.

Thus, I tightly implemented what the driver tests. This is not good,
but the project seems not worth that much time to me now. It's merely
software engineering effort.
